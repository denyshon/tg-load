# How to contribute

First of all, welcome, and thanks for your attention to the project!

Before you contribute, please make sure you have an **issue** to work on. It may be an existing bug report or feature request, but if you want to suggest something new, please create an issue first.

Additionally, I would appreciate you mentioning me (@denyshon), so that I can **assign** you to the issue (and we don't end up with several people working on it independently).

When coding, please try to follow the existing **code style**. However, that's not critical and can be fixed later, so chill out :)

What's more important, in case of major changes, please perform some **testing**. Run the bot (referring to the instructions in README) and make sure that:
- All the new features/changes work as expected.
- All the existing features work as before.

And finally, I would really appreciate you selecting **Allow edits from maintainers** when opening a pull request. That will allow me to make the necessary changes to your PR.
