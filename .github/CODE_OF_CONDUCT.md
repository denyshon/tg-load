# Code of Conduct

The rules are simple, and you, most likely, are already following them:
- Treat everyone with respect. Avoid discriminatory, harassing, or offensive behavior.
- If someone finds some style of communication (remarks, jokes, comments, etc.) unacceptable, avoid using that style with them.
- Do not post advertising or promotional content. However, feel free to mention other projects with non-advertising purposes.
